# config-files

Currently running arch linux with hyprland and KDE; I'm also trying out Niri. Quickshell is used for topbar and application launcher as opposed to using separate softwares like waybar for the topbar and wofi/rofi for the application launcher. eww seems truly terrible and QT is pretty easy to get. Hyprland config is a highly edited version of the dotfiles done by **Stephan Raabe (mylinuxforwork)** , and the quickshell config is a combination of my own work and the quickshell configs of **outfoxxed** and **Zaphkiel**.
