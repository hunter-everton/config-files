# config-files

Currently running arch linux and both hyprland and KDE. Quickshell is used for topbar and application launcher as opposed to using separate softwares like waybar for the topbar and wofi/rofi for the application launcher. eww seems truly terrible and QT is pretty easy to get. Hyprland config is a highly edited version of the dotfiles done by **Stephan Raabe (mylinuxforwork)** , and the quickshell config is a combination of my own work and the quickshell configs of **outfoxxed** and **Zaphkiel**.
